The figure above shows the optimal solution for building the word ladder from "BIDET" to "SPRAY."
- (3 points) Based on the solution provided, explain how you will convert this into a search problem. Your answer should define the set of states and what actions move you from one state to another.

- (2 points) Which of the two algorithms will provide you with the optimal solution? Why?



start word | End word | new of node expanded | solution length |
